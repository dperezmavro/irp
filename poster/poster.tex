            \block{Microcontroller Introduction}{
                Microcontrollers can be found anywhere, from your cars stereo to missile launch panels. Mictrocontrollers are the CPU of a small embedded system and are usually cheap (around \pounds 2) and widely available for hobbyists to play or companies to use in their products. 
                
                As microcontrollers are used in serious applicationsas well, they often come with crypto-engines (AES, DES and RSA are common) and hold all sorts of information like private crypto-keys for authentication or propietary algorithm implementations.
            }
            \block{Packaging and De-packaging}{
				Typically microcontrollers are too small to use like they are fabricated, as fabrication lengths have shrank to micro-meters, and so they are packaged\citep{hwre}. Packacking material ranges depending on the microcontroller and its intended use
