\section*{\emph{Abstract}}
\emph{This paper will review some of the attacks used against microcontrollers in order to obtain access to cryptographic material (keys or algorithms) or the firmware of the device, both of which have serious implications. Defence techniques developed against the attacks will also be reviewed, in an attempt to show the co-evolutionary nature of the attack-defence ecosystem. We conclude by presenting a working attack against a microcontroller and by discussing why completely securing a microcontroller is impossible and that manufacturers should focus on making hacking the microcontroller "hard enough" in terms of money and cost.}
