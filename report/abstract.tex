\begin{abstract}
This paper will review some of the attacks used against microcontrollers in order to obtain access to cryptographic material (keys or algorithms) or the firmware of the device and the defence techniques developed in responce, in an attempt to show the co-evolutionary nature of the attack-defence ecosystem. We outline a possible attack against the Atmel ATmega644 synthesized by techniques applied to similar devices and conclude by discussing why completely securing a microcontroller is impossible and that manufacturers should instead  make their product uninteresting to attack, where interest is measured both monetarily and by the effort required.
