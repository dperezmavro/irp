\begin{abstract}
In this paper we will propose a possible non-invasive clock-glitch attack against the popular AVR ATmega644 microcontroller with the aim of obtaining access to the firmware or cryptographic material, synthesised by relevant research performed on a similar board of the AVR family. We will also present current attacks on microcontrollers and the protective mechanisms developed in response in order to understand how the proposed attack works, concluding with the sad realization that absolute security is an illusion and manufacturers should instead make their products secure "enough" based on a given threat model.
