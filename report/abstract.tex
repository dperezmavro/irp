\begin{abstract}
In this paper we will propose a possible non-invasive clock-glitch attack against the popular AVR ATmega644 microcontroller with the aim of obtaining access to the firmware or cryptographic material, synthesised from research performed on boards with similar architectural properties. We will also present current attacks on microcontrollers, and the protective mechanisms developed in response, in order to understand how the proposed attack works, concluding with the sad realization that absolute security is an illusion and manufacturers should instead try to make their products secure "enough" based on a given threat model.
