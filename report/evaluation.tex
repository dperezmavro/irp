\label{sec:conclusion}

No system is unbreakable and one can only harden their system enough to make the effort of breaking it unbearable to those they wish to protect against\citep{anderson:cautionary_note}\cite{sergei:thesis}.

security is hard to do because one must carefully analyse and model all threats \citep{kocher:DPA}
	\subsection{Attacks and Solutions overview}
	present how expensive it would be for someone to put together a probing station and in general give estimations of cost  and skillset required for various attack categories
