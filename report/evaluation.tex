\red{mention why security is complicated}

No system is unbreakable and one can only harden their system enough to make the effort of breaking it unbearable to those they wish to protect against\citep{anderson:cautionary_note}\cite{sergei:thesis}.

security is hard to do because one must carefully analyse and model all threats \citep{kocher:DPA}
	\subsection{Attacks and Solutions overview}
	present how expensive it would be for someone to put together a probing station and in general give estimations of cost  and skillset required for various attack categories
	\subsection{Conclusions}

security/shielding adds to a device's cost and size \citep{kocher:DPA} and there is a tradeoff \citep{sergei:thesis}


companies tend to make security claims for their products that do not stand or to market their protection as sufficient\citep{sergei:thesis}. atmega are popular and represent a typical low-cost microcontroller \citep{glitches_paper}. 

who needs secure chips ? car industry, service providers, manufacturers of various devices, banking industry and the military \url{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sps32/ECRYPT2011_1.pdf}
