\section{Countermeasures to known attacks}
\label{sec:defenses}
\subsection{Physical Protection}
asic glue logic design, protective metal-mesh layer, shrink things, mesh of wires, encase in epoxy, make layers destroy each other if removed. doping can also reduce light penetration to reduce imaging attacks 
\subsubsection{Protection circuits}
radiation/temperature/voltage/frequency detector circuits that cause reset on abnormality detection (instability reference \citep{anderson:cautionary_note}). add transistors on top to hide true signal (provide reference)
 keep keys in own, self powered module.
\subsection{Side-channel Protection}
decrease signal/noise ratio (either by introducing noise or making the signal smaller), constant time/power operatations, insert random delays\citep{sergei:thesis}, \citep{kocher:DPA} and shielding the device.

Planarization defeats optical inspection with microscope (source: Introduction to hardware security and trust, sergei skorobogatov paper).\\

	\item overview of most popular techniques \\
	\item benefits and how they improve the situation/approach the problem
	\item added cost for this investment (in terms of hardware and money, transparency to the developers, runtime overhead etc)\\
	\end{itemize}
	
	perhaps review some popular secure chips ?? IBM 4758 is a secure device \footnote{\href{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/descrack/ibm4758.html}{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/descrack/ibm4758.html}}, some Dallas chips and perhaps more.
	
	thermally enhanced packaging : makes difficult to microprobe chips as they need to be cooled or they'll fry [slides of hardware reveng module] and careful decaping needed
	
	ceramic packaging (Al2O3 is common, often mixed with SiO2, AlN and BeO) is extremely chemical resistant and seals very good, but can crack
	
	potting : protects board from environment[water/dirt] but might also make tampering harder and may need to be removed
	conformal coating : same deal as potting, but it's a thin layer that doesn't fill the enclosure but just covers the top.
	underfill : provides stability but gets in the way as well(makes desoldering harder).
