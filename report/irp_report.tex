\section{Attacks on Hardware}
\label{sec:curr_attacks}
A distinction between \emph{passive} and \emph{active} attacks should be made. In the former the attacker simply monitors the chip's normal operation and tries to infer the input-output mapping whereas in the latter case the attacker actively manipulates either the chip or its operating environment with the aim of obtaining insight on the chips inner workings. 

Attacks on MCUs may attempt to recover a number of artefacts, including cryptographic keys the firmware and do not need to necessarily attack the hardware itself but can exploit flaws in algorithmic design and implementation and protocol failures or inter-component communication patterns\citep{anderson:cautionary_note}\citep{kocher:DPA}, obtain information by corrupting the memory or exploiting memory remanence\citep{sergei:thesis}\citep{gutman:memory_remanence}.

	\subsection{Non-Invasive Attacks}
	Non-invasive attacks are attacks which require no de-packaging or special preparation of the chip and hence attacks under this category leave little tamper evidence behind. These attacks might be very time consuming and are not guaranteed to be successful, but are very easy and cheap to replicate once found. Furthermore, non-invasive attacks could target badly implemented communication or security protocols in order to bypass security restrictions.
	
	\subsubsection{Power Analysis}
	\label{subsubsec:power_analysis}
	Different instructions executing on a CPU require different amounts of power, and hence one can infer which instruction is executing on a CPU by analysing a power trace generated by the MCU. These attacks are easy and relatively inexpensive to perform as they only require widely available tools.
	
	Simple Power Analysis(SPA) involves direct observation of the MCU when it performs cryptographic operations and can leak information about both the keys and the cryptographic operations themselves (i.e. nature or structure of the algorithm). 

	Differential Power Analysis(DPA) extracts sensitive information by using statistical techniques on very large traces. The techniques involves obtaining power traces of known ciphertexts(but not necessarily knowing the ciphertexts) and individual bits of the key are recovered by analysing the differences in power consumption\citep{kocher:DPA}.
	
	One can generally avoid noise in their power measurements by sampling the voltage (usually) on the ground line.
	\subsubsection{Glitch Attacks}
	power/clock glitch attacks
	\subsubsection{Data Remanence}
	Data remanence \citep{anderson:tamper_resistance}\citep{gutman:memory_remanence},
	\subsubsection{Timing Attacks}
	Timing attacks are possible because of the software implementation of cryptographic algorithms, where compiler optimisations (avoiding unnecessary branches, register and cache usage) and other implementation choices make the execution time of an algorithm dependent on the input and the secret key, rather than having a fixed time for every key. A characteristic example would be when an input is compared byte-wise with a key and rejected when the first non-matching byte is found, rather than first consuming the whole input string.
	
	Different instructions take different time to execute(e.g. \texttt{MOV eax,[eax]} is considerably slower than \texttt{INC eax}) and thus one could collect timing information on various input messages and systematically deduce the correct key. 
	
	If timing information is correlated with power analysis then defences such as constant instruction execution time could be defeated. For example, one might use \texttt{NOP}s in the case of a wrong key in order for rejection and confirmation responses to have constant execution time. However, \texttt{NOP} would consume substantially less power than \texttt{INC eax} and hence correlating timing and power consumption information could prove dangerous.

	\subsection{Semi-Invasive Attacks}
	some sort of fault injection?
		all memory types are linear( as well as memory mapped IO) - related to memory scanning attacks by glitching and power faults (stop making call or jump instructions)
	\subsection{Invasive Attacks}
	mention decaping and chip exposure. can be done by sending to hardware failure test labs\citep{website:hacking_the_pic} or by chemicals etc \citep{anderson:cautionary_note}
