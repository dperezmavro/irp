\section{Attacking The ATmega}
\label{sec:attacking_mega}

The ATmega644 represents a standard low-cost microcontroller that could be used for 

 is a typical MCU that is susceptible to a successful attack by the \textbf{Home-Hacker} class of attackers due to its weak protective mechanisms. While there is a way to deliver firmware updates to the MCU securely\citep{tech:aes_bls}, keeping the firmware secure on the device is impossible.

companies tend to make security claims for their products that do not stand or to market their protection as sufficient\citep{sergei:thesis}. atmega are popular and represent a typical low-end microcontroller \citep{glitches_paper}. have not found anything current. 

\red{mention service that breaks chips. mention ChipWhisperer paper. perhaps mention pipeline/give examples of clock glitch. mention that no paper found targeting these devices. \citep{glitches_paper} this guy breaks and \citep{sergei:theis} and website of chinese dude that break atmels.}
