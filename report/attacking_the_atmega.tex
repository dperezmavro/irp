\section{Attacking The ATmega}
\label{sec:attacking_mega}

The ATmega is a typical MCU that is susceptible to a successful attack by the \textbf{Home-Hacker} class of attackers due to its weak protective mechanisms. While there is a way to deliver firmware updates to the MCU securely\citep{tech:aes_bls}, keeping the firmware secure on the device is impossible.

The motivation behind attacking the ATmega 688/1284 is their popularity and to prove how easy it is
